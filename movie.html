            <p><b>In 1971, the Pakistan Air Force suddenly attack an Indian airbase due to the Kashmir conflict. In retaliation, the Indian Air Force captures a Pakistani pilot, Ahmed. Upon interrogating him, Wing Commander K. O. Ahuja discovers that he was awarded for killing an Indian officer in the 1965 war.

                In 1965, Ahuja and his teammates including T. K. Vijaya are at the Adampur Airbase. Vijaya a.k.a. Tabby always sets his seniors for breaking protocols nonetheless is a skilled and patriotic pilot. He shares a close bond with Ahuja as he considers him as his mentor while Ahuja sees his late brother Monu in Vijaya. Ahuja's senior David Lawrence informs him that the United States has strengthened Pakistan by giving them 12 Star Striker fighter planes. On receiving confidential information about a possible attack from Pakistan, David instructs Ahuja to go on a recce along with one more officer and cross the border at his own risk. During the recce, Ahuja and Tabby discover several weapons and artillery at the Pakistan border. Despite getting noticed by Pakistani officers, Tabby clicks pictures of the weapons.</b></p>
                <br>
                
            <p><b>After analysing the pictures, Ahuja suggests that India should attack before Pakistan can execute their plan. Lawrence dismisses the idea as the government would not agree with India attacking first as a result of human rights. Soon after, Pakistan attacks the Indian airbase at night, knowing that India does not have any planes that can fight at night. They destroy the airbase, stationed fighter planes, and kill Indian soldiers. In retaliation, the Indian government decide upon a counterattack to destroy Pakistan's important air bases and their Star Striker planes. While strategizing, Ahuja gets to know from the Pakistani PM's speech that the Star Striker planes are placed in the central part of the country, at the Sargodha Airbase. The mission is named "Sky Force".

                The mission is tough for India, due to the existing planes not having the fuel capacity which can bring them back to Adampur after attacking Sargodha. Ahuja assembles four teams for the mission but on Lawrence's order, he keeps Tabby on standby and not as part of the four core teams. The mission gets accomplished and all the officers return to their bases. On returning, Ahuja learns that Tabby took off a few minutes after his designated time and has gone missing. The Indian government turns a blind eye to finding Tabby, labelling him as rebellious for not following orders. In the meantime, Tabby's wife Geeta urges Ahuja to find him as he had earlier promised her that he will take care of Tabby as his younger brother. Despite his best efforts, he does not receive any support from the government, who try to label his disappearance as his own fault.</b></p>
